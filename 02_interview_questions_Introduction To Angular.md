## How SPA is different from traditional webapplications

### Explanation
Multi-page applications are the traditional web applications that reload the entire page and displays the new one when a user interacts with the web app. Each time when a data is exchanged back and forth, a new page is requested from the server to display in the web browser. This process takes time to generate the pages on the server, sending it to a client and displaying in the browser which may affect the user experience. However, AJAX had made it possible to render just a particular component of the application, but this makes the development process even more difficult and complex.
**Benefits of Multi-Page Applications**
 - Performs well on the search engine.
 - Provides a visual map of the web app to the user.
 **Drawbacks of Multi-Page Applications** 
 - Comparatively complex development.
 - Coupled backend and frontend

As per the name suggests single page applications consists just one single page. SPAs present the content in an easy, elegant and effective way as it loads all the content on just one single page rather than navigating the user to different pages. SPAs are faster than traditional web applications because they execute the logic in the web browser itself rather than on the server. And after the initial page load, only data is sent back and forth instead of the entire HTML that reduces the bandwidth. 
**Benefits of Single Page Applications**
- Single Page Apps are smooth and fast.
- They are easy to develop and deploy.SPAs are easier to debug.Can be transited to mobile apps by reusing the same backend code.
**Drawbacks of Single Page Applications**
- SPAs perform poor on the search engine. But now, with isomorphic rendering/server-side rendering even SPAs can be optimized for search engine.
- Single page applications provide single sharing link.
- They are less secure compared to traditional multi-page apps because of its cross-site scripting.
